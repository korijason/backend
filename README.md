# MyFedha Finance Manager App - Backend

**MyFedha** is a finance management web application designed to help users manage their budgets, expenses, and income. This repository contains the backend for the **MyFedha Finance Manager App**, built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

The backend handles API requests to manage users' budgets, expenses, and income, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete financial records.

## Features

1. **Budget Management**:
   - Create, update, view, and delete budget entries.

2. **Expense Management**:
   - Create, update, view, and delete expense entries.

3. **Income Management**:
   - Create, update, view, and delete income entries.

4. **CRUD API Endpoints**:
   - **Budgets**: Handle operations related to budgets.
   - **Expenses**: Handle operations related to expenses.
   - **Incomes**: Handle operations related to incomes.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express** – Web framework for Node.js to create RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database to store budget, expense, and income data.
- **Mongoose** – ODM for MongoDB to interact with the database.
- **Body-parser** – Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
- **dotenv** – To manage environment variables.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.
- You must have **MongoDB** installed locally or use a cloud MongoDB service (like MongoDB Atlas).

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/korijason/backend.git
   cd backend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Running the Application
Before running the app, create a .env file in the root of the project to configure environment variables:

env
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myfedha
PORT=5000
This assumes you are running MongoDB locally on port 27017. If you're using a cloud MongoDB service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas), replace MONGO_URI with your MongoDB connection string.

Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Or, to run in development mode with auto-reloading:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
The app will be running at http://localhost:5000.

API Endpoints
Below are the key API endpoints available:

Budgets Endpoints
GET /api/budget: Fetch all budget entries.
POST /api/budget: Create a new budget entry.
PUT /api/budget/:id: Update an existing budget entry.
DELETE /api/budget/:id: Delete a specific budget entry.
Expenses Endpoints
GET /api/expense: Fetch all expense entries.
POST /api/expense: Create a new expense entry.
PUT /api/expense/:id: Update an existing expense entry.
DELETE /api/expense/:id: Delete a specific expense entry.
Incomes Endpoints
GET /api/income: Fetch all income entries.
POST /api/income: Create a new income entry.
PUT /api/income/:id: Update an existing income entry.
DELETE /api/income/:id: Delete a specific income entry.
MongoDB Setup
Ensure MongoDB is set up either locally or remotely (using MongoDB Atlas, for instance). The backend uses Mongoose to interact with MongoDB.

If you're using MongoDB Atlas, replace the MONGO_URI in the .env file with your connection string provided by Atlas.
Building for Production
To build the app for production, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will generate the production build in the build/ directory.
